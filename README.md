Quecho is a simple addon design with leveling duos in mind.  It helps you keep
track of your partner's quest progress.

<b>Both players must run Quecho for it to work.</b>  Players in your party not
running Quecho will not be bothered with your quest info.

Quecho was written because I never level solo.  I got sick of constantly asking
my leveling partner if he had his quest items, or him missing when I accepted a
quest and not grabbing it himself.  Quecho provides a few basic features:

* Chatframe notifications when your partner accepts, turns in, or abandons a quest
* A second "quest watch" frame that shows your partner's progress on curent quest objectives next to the default quest watch frame
* Automatic exchange of "Quest item: 2/200" messages as quests are completed

There is no config, if enabled Quecho will send addon messages, and display any
it receives.  Messages have a 5 minute timeout, and are automatically removed
after that expires.

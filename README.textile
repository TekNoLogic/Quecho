Quecho is a simple addon design with leveling duos in mind.  It helps you keep track of your partner's quest progress.

<b>Both players must run Quecho for it to work.</b>  Players in your party not running Quecho will not be bothered with your quest info.

Quecho was written because I never level solo.  I got sick of constantly asking my leveling partner if he had his quest items, or him missing when I accepted a quest and not grabbing it himself.  Quecho provides a few basic features:

* Chatframe notifications when your partner accepts, turns in, or abandons a quest
* A second "quest watch" frame that shows your partner's progress on curent quest objectives next to the default quest watch frame
* Automatic exchange of "Quest item: 2/200" messages as quests are completed

There is no config, if enabled Quecho will send addon messages, and display any it receives.  Messages have a 5 minute timeout, and are automatically removed after that expires.
